### Software and Libraries
This project uses the following software and libraries:
* [Python 2.7 or higher](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [Numpy](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/)
* [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install)
* [matplotlib](https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/)
* [scikit-learn](https://pypi.org/project/scikit-learn/)
* [Bokeh](https://pypi.org/project/bokeh/)

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the Anaconda distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included.
